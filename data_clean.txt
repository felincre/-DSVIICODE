When the IPYNB is executed, the cleaned data will be saved in a specified folder in compressed gz format. 
The DaskDataFrame will perform npartitions on the pandas dataframe, and the number of partitions will depend on the specified number of chunks and the size of the dataset. 
However, the number of partitions may also be influenced by the amount of available RAM on the local machine. 
In this particular case, the DaskDataFrame created 91 partitions.
